<br/>
<br/>

<h3 class="steps"><span>Step 1</span> Your idea</h3>

<div class="steps-content">
  <p>Before shisaa.be starts to design and build your homepage, it is important that you get a clear idea of what it is you wish to communicate.
     Some questions you have to ask yourself when thinking about your homepage are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What market am I approaching (b2b, b2c, ...)?</li>
  <li>Who is my target audience (young, old, male, female, ...)?</li>
  <li>What is the purpose of my homepage (informational, educational, ...)?</li>
  <li>What is the actual story I want to tell to people?</li>
  <li>How do you want people to find your homepage (SEO, marketing, blogs, networking ...)?</li>
  <li>How do you want people to come back to your homepage after their first visit (newsletter, blog, ...)?</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3 class="steps"><span>Step 2</span> Setup the site structure</h3>

<div class="steps-content">
	<p>After you have a sharp idea of what you want to tell and to who, it is time to put that into a site structure.
	   When talking about strcture, you have to think about things such as which menu items do you wish to have and how many pages you think you need.</p>

	<p>Most homepages consist out of a landing or index page which tells the main story and invites people to explore more.
	   Besides the index page you usually have the following extra pages:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>An about page, which tells your visitors who you are</li>
		<li>A contact page, which allows your visitors to contact you via email or phone</li>
		<li>Pages that tell your story in more detail</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In both the previous and this step, shisaa.be will give you guidance into getting your idea and structure fixed.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="steps"><span>Step 3</span> Designing your homepage</h3>

<div class="steps-content">
	<p>After the idea and structure are laid down, it is time to make it look beautiful.
	   Together with your input, shisaa.be will propose a design for your homepage, a graphical look & feel.</p>
	<p>This design will encompass the landing page, basic page elements (forms, tables, lists, ...) and a basic design for additional pages.</p>
	<p>A maximum of three alteration request can be made within the proposed design budget (see pricing table below).</p>
	<p>We highly appreciate and encourage our customers input. If you have your own designer, or your own pictures, do not hesitate to present them during this step.
	   Your designs, pictures and other elements will be carefully inspected and their usefullness for the web will be discussed with you.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="steps"><span>Step 4</span> Building the site</h3>

<div class="steps-content">
	<p>After you have approved the design, it is time to actually deploy the Drupal CMS and start to put together the various modules and components that make up your custom homepage.</p>
	<p>When the building process is finished, it will be presented to you on a development server, awaiting your approval.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="steps"><span>Step 5</span> Server setup</h3>

<div class="steps-content">
	<p>The final step, once the build is approved, is to setup your own, actual production server which will be used to serve your homepage.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="steps"><span>Done</span> Now, have fun!</h3>

<div class="steps-content">
	<p>Once your site is fully operational, it is yours to explore and expand. You will have full access to the CMS backend and can make as many pages as you desire.</p>
</div>

An important note is that each phase (consulting, design, development, server) will be billed separately.
