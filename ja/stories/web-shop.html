<p>Web shops are a special kind of web application that combine a corporate homepage with an online shopping system.
Shisaa.jp employs its many years of experience in the Drupal CMS system together with the Drupal Commerce web shop suite, to provide you with a modern, fully customizable, open source web shop.</p>
<p>To give you a better look at how Shisaa.jp helps you to create your web shop, please take a look at the following steps from idea to finished project:
<br><br></p>
<h4 class="steps">
<span>Step 1</span> Your idea, your shop</h4>

<div class="steps-content">
  <p>Closely related to the workflow of setting up a corporate homepage, everything start with your initial idea and the questions you have to ask yourself:</p>
  <ul>
<li>Who is my target audience, which kind of people do I like to buy my products?</li>
      <li>What is the message I want to tell these people?</li>
  </ul>
<p>Shisaa.jp will help you to form your idea as best as possible, guiding you in the process.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="steps">
<span>Step 2</span> Setup the shop structure</h4>

<div class="steps-content">
    <p>After you have a sharp idea of what you want to tell and to who, it is time to put that into a shop structure.
       When talking about structure, you have to think about things such as which menu items do you wish to have and how many pages you think you need.</p>

    <p>Most web shops consist out of a landing or index page which tells the main story and invites people to go and explore the actual shop.
       Besides the index page you usually have the following extra pages:</p>

    <ul>
<li>An about page, which tells your visitors who you are</li>
        <li>A contact page, which allows your visitors to contact you via email or phone</li>
        <li>Pages that tell your story in more detail</li>
    </ul>
<p>After you have your corporate information structured, you will need to take a look at which features you wish to have inside your shop. How would you like your visitors to use the web shop?</p>

    <p>In both the previous and this step, Shisaa.jp will give you guidance into getting your idea and structure fixed.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="steps">
<span>Step 3</span> Designing the web shop</h4>

<div class="steps-content">
    <p>After the idea and structure are laid down, it is time to make it look beautiful.
       Together with your input, Shisaa.jp will propose a design for your web shop, a graphical look &amp; feel.</p>
    <p>This design will encompass the landing page, basic page elements (forms, tables, lists, ...), a basic design for additional pages, a design for product listings and a design for a detail product page.</p>
    <p>A maximum of three alteration request can be made within the proposed design budget (see pricing table below).</p>
    <p>We highly appreciate and encourage our customers input. If you have your own designer, or your own pictures, do not hesitate to present them during this step.
       Your designs, pictures and other elements will be carefully inspected and their usefullness for the web will be discussed with you.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="steps">
<span>Step 4</span> Coding the web application</h4>

<div class="steps-content">
    <p>After you have approved the design, it is time to actually deploy the Drupal CMS and start to put together the various modules and components that make up your custom web shop.</p>
    <p>When the building process is finished, it will be presented to you on a development server, awaiting your approval.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="steps">
<span>Step 5</span> Server setup</h4>

<div class="steps-content">
    <p>The final step, once the build is approved, is to setup your own, actual production server which will be used to serve your web shop.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="steps">
<span>Done</span> Now, start to sell!</h4>

<div class="steps-content">
    <p>Once your web shop is fully operational, it is yours to explore and expand. You will have full access to the CMS and shop backend and can make as many pages and products as you desire.</p>
</div>

<p>An important note is that each phase (consulting, design, development, server) will be billed separately.</p>

<h3>What does it cost?</h3>
